Metahub Contracts
=====================

Metahub is an open-source, permissionless, and modular dynamic credit Swap protocol. Through dynamic credit Swap, users can autonomously release credit-native NFT communities and create credit-native NFT assets. This protocol can intelligently combine, nest, and interoperate NFTs of community credentials, equity certificates, and access keys.

Dynamic credit NFT is a paradigm innovation for decentralized collaboration. The flywheel effect of credit expansion will strongly promote the continuous development of decentralized collaboration. The protocol can use dynamic credit to enhance the decentralized collaboration ecosystem, allowing users to more conveniently use and manage digital assets. In addition, Metahub can combine NFTs with credit mechanisms to improve the liquidity and transaction efficiency of NFTs, further promoting the development of the NFT ecosystem.
